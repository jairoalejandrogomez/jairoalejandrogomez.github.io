## Welcome to my website

My name is Jairo Alejandro Gómez, I have a bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering from Universidad del Valle (Cali, Colombia) and a PhD in Engineering from the Australian Centre for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney (Australia). Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Developer at the Center of Excellence and Adoption on the Internet of Things (CEA-IoT) at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, in Cali.

During the last couple of years, I have worked with computer vision, image processing, and machine learning (including deep learning) as a lecturer, supervisor, researcher and practitioner. Recently, I have been working in projects that bring pattern recognition and computer vision to the “edge” using GPU-enabled embedded platforms and mobile devices. These projects are scaled through fast data ingestion, elastic storage and visualization services available in the Cloud.

With this website, I intend to publish some of the code that I have written over the years in C++, Python and Matlab in areas such as digital image processing, digital signal processing, computer vision, machine learning, and embedded computing, and other various topics. 

Please keep an eye on this website for updates !!
